        I have recently completed all components of my MSCS degree at the University of Kansas (KU) where I also received my bachelor's degree in computer science in 2023. Now, I am actively seeking new-grad and junior developer roles. 
        <br> <br>        
        Outside of my engineering coursework, I studied illustration and animation in KU's School of Design. I would love to find a position where I can combine my computing skills with my artistic tendencies. 
        <br> <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy drawing, baking, socializing, and exercising.

        I was so lucky to be a teaching assistant for "Discrete Structures" (EECS 210) for all 4 semesters of graduate school. EECS 210 covers foundational computer science concepts, and course content spans across topics such as programming and algorithms, logic, proofs, and statistics. Course enrollment would range from 80 - 175 students each semester, and as a GTA, I would have between 20 and 50 of those students in my lab section(s) each week. <br><br> In my last semester teaching (Spring 2025), I was honored with a nomination for the Huebner Award - a departmental award recognizing teaching excellence among the GTAs.

          I was one of two graduate students onboarded to The Care Board in Summer 2024. We worked as interns and graduate research assistants under the supervision of the lead data scientist Dr. Joseph Bommarito. My duties included gathering and analyzing data records, aiding in construction of a centralized data warehouse with reputable sources such as Census / IPUMS data. To verify statistic correctness, I was also provided with numbers calculated by other members of the team and was asked to reconstruct solutions and explain how I arrived at my conclusions.

        KU's Summer Engineering Camp is an opportunity for high school students to explore the various disciplines in the school of engineering. The camp is primarily led by graduate teaching and research assistants and features faculty presentations, experiments, and self-led projects. I was one of 7 GTA's onboarded to camp staff and represented the electrical engineering and computer science, or EECS, department. My duties involved guiding and supervising students, assisting with labs, and instructing students on the topics of computing disciplines and cryptography.

        Genetic algorithms are evolutionary algorithms that mimick the process of natural selection. "Children," or chromosomes, are considered as candidate solutions of a designated "fitness function." In this case, the children I created were 736-bit binary strings. Bits within the sequence identified characteristics such as a certain shape, color, size, etc. Each child represented one canvased artwork with 32 shapes at 23 bits per shape. I engineered the fitness function to evaluate each canvas with a variety of design elements (as color harmony, symmetry, and shape diversity). Each element could be weighted more or less heavily to promote or demote certain visual aspects of a painting. Optimal solutions identified by the fitness function are given a higher score and also a higher chance of reproducing. Children are mutated and evolved through hundreds or thousands of iterations to arrive at one optimal solution which is virtually drawn, saved, and outputted as a PNG.
        <br><br>
        After implementation, I presented my findings underscoring the continued value of genetic algorithms as a medium for user-guided creative expression. The rise of gradient-based optimization has resulted in more limited use-cases of GAs, but genetic algorithms still have applications in various settings such as hyperparameter tuning, mathematical optimization, reinforcement learning, and black box scenarios. Neural networks are favored presently in image generation due to their pattern recognition and ability to produce new content; however, in cases where a user is seeking to implement their own vision through careful algorithmic refinement, genetic algorithms still find a place in visual computing.

        For our senior capstone project, my team and I were prompted to draft a project idea during the fall semester of our senior year and to bring it to fruition in the spring. We chose to create a game in Unity using our own lore based on events and characters of the ancient Near East. Nineveh placed first amongst our class of 2022 seniors making us the recipients of The Niehaus Award for outstanding workmanship and innovation.

        We combined efforts not only as programmers, but as storytellers and artists. We learned that collaborating with others who possess both a diverse set of skills and a unified vision can lead to not only a beautiful, worthwhile project, but a successful, well-packaged launch. This ensures that the product of your passion and hard work lands in the open, exuberant hands of your audience.
